# Mini Project: Mikuru
Mikuru is a clock webpage, similar to Google's [Clock app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.deskclock) on Google Play. Mikuru will have the clock, timer and stopwatch features of Google's Clock app, as well as a dark/light theme switcher. It is built with various components from [Material Components Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web).
